Hi, my name is Petros Petrou, I was born in 1980 and my hometown is Levadia, Greece.
The last 10+ years I live in London and currently work for Red Hat UK&I as a Cloud Consultant.
My area of expertise is RHEL, Virtualization and Platform Build Automation.

Although my past technical background is in application development and middleware I have developed a passion for Infrastructure and Cloud Technologies since joining Red Hat.

The Red Hat Products I have worked most are the following, and I always look forward to learn more...

* RHEL
* Openstack
* Anaconda Installer
* RHEV
* Ansible

I also have an MEng. Software Engineering degree from Aberystwyth University (2005).

My hobbies / interests are Snowboard, hiking and Golf.
